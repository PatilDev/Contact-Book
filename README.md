**Contact Book app **

Introduction
The Phone Book Project is a comprehensive application designed to manage contact information efficiently. Developed using Java for the application logic and MySQL for the database management, this project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for storing, retrieving, updating, and deleting contact details.

Objectives
•	To create a robust and scalable phone book application.
•	To leverage Java for a seamless user interface and backend processing.
•	To utilize MySQL for efficient data storage and management.
•	To implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contacts.

Features
1.	Add Contacts:
a.	Users can add new contacts with details such as name, phone number, email, and address.
2.	View Contacts:
a.	Users can view a list of all saved contacts in a structured format.
3.	Update Contacts:
a.	Users can update existing contact information.
4.	Delete Contacts:
a.	Users can delete unwanted contacts.

Technologies Used
•	Java:
o	Core Java for application logic.
o	Java Swing for GUI (Graphical User Interface).
o	JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database interaction.
•	MySQL:
o	Database management system for storing and managing contact information.
Database Design
•	Tables:
o	contacts: Stores contact details with fields for ID, name, phone number, email, and address.
o	users: Stores user credentials for authentication.
Implementation Details
•	Java Swing: Provides a user-friendly GUI for the application.
•	JDBC: Facilitates interaction between the Java application and the MySQL database.
•	MySQL: Manages the storage, retrieval, and manipulation of contact data.
Conclusion
The Phone Book Project serves as a practical example of integrating Java with MySQL to develop a functional and user-friendly application. It demonstrates core programming concepts such as GUI design, database interaction, and secure user authentication, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements and real-world applications.
